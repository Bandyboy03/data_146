This was my first Slice of Data presentation that I have seen. Hearing how predictions for roads or images were created from different models and datasets was extremely
interesting. I am not planning on becoming a statistics or computer science major, so I am not really knowledgeable in the topic or field. So, to be completely honest, a
lot of the details and pieces of the presentation were lost on me. Regardless, the presentation linked with several of the topics that we learned in class, making some points
easier to understand.
